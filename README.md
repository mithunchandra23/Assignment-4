# Assignment-4

This repository contains Python scripts for two tasks: creating and retrieving student marks using a dictionary and demonstrating list slicing techniques.

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.  
2. Asks the user to input a student's name.  
3. Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.  
4. If the studentâ€™s name is not found, displays an appropriate message.

### Features:
- Uses a dictionary to store student names and their corresponding marks.
- Accepts user input to search for a specific student's marks.
- Displays the marks if the student is found in the dictionary.
- Gracefully handles the case where the student's name is not present.

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.  
2. Extracts the first five elements from the list.  
3. Reverses these extracted elements.  
4. Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

### Features:
- Demonstrates how to create and manipulate lists in Python.
- Shows how to use slicing to extract a portion of a list.
- Uses built-in methods to reverse a list.
- Clearly prints the intermediate and final results for understanding.
