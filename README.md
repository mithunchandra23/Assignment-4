# Assignment-4

This repository contains Python scripts for two tasks: reading and handling errors in files and writing/appending data to files.

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
2. Prints its content line by line.
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

### Features:
- Attempts to open and read the file `sample.txt`.
- If the file exists, prints its content line by line.
- If the file does not exist, gracefully handles the error and prints an appropriate message.


### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`.
2. Appends additional data to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.

### Features:
- Takes input from the user and writes it to `output.txt`.
- Appends more user input to the same file.
- Reads the final content of the file and displays it.
